# New-wheels-project-Showcasing-ETL-with-SQL
This is an end to end ETL project using SQL. New Wheels sales have been dipping steadily in the past year and due to the critical customer feedback and ratings online, there is a drop in new customers every quarter, which is concerning. The CEO of the company now wants a quarterly report with all the key metrics sent to him so he can assess the health of the business and make the necessary decisions.

The data is not organized and is dumped as flat files only to be used occasionally. I created a pipeline to organize and maintain this data using SQL database so that it becomes easy to answer business questions. Then, I used the data to create queries to answer some business questions
